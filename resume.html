					<h2>Personal Information</h2>
					<p>Yukino is a beautiful teenage girl with waist-length black hair which is tied with two red ribbons by each shoulder and angular blue eyes. She changed her hairstyle into twin tails when she went out with Hachiman Hikigaya and Komachi Hikigaya (but ended up with just Yukino and Hachiman) to buy a birthday present for Yui Yuigahama. Yukino is mostly seen wearing her school uniform, which consists of a black blazer with a white shirt underneath it, a red ribbon tie, a plaid skirt and black stockings up to her knees. Even though she is seen as flat-chested compared to most of the other female characters, she is still considered to be beautiful.</p>
					<p>In the drama CD, Yukino mentions that it snowed at the time of her birth, so her parents named her Yukino which literally means snow in Japanese. Her family is on good terms with Hayato's family. Their families' relationship is not known by many in the school. During her childhood, Haruno would watch over both Hayama and her, when their parents were in a business trip. It was also mentioned that the trio has been to the amusement park where Haruno would mess with them resulting in the fear of rides for Yukino.</p>
					<p>She studied with Hayama in an elementary school overseas (the USA in the light novel). It was mentioned that in elementary school her indoor shoes was stolen from her about sixty times, but fifty of those times were done by girls in her class. Her upperclassmen harassed her frequently. All of this due to the fact that she is beautiful and famous, attracting unwanted attention from people.</p>
					<p>It was around the time during middle school when Yukino came back to Japan from overseas. She had to transfer into a random school, but all the girls in her class, or rather, all the girls of her school were desperate to drive her out. But none of them tried to prove themselves better than her, to whom Yukino refers as imbeciles. Boys who approached her, generally did so because of their harbored-feelings for her which began from the final year of her middle school.</p>
